Features that I need:
-Scoreboard
-Carddisplay (Take array of objects, display then using the mapping, state initially together with (clicked = false))

-Random order of the array (How do I randomize the order of the array?) 

-Oncardclick: array is gon take a random order, and its gonna check the current run (should be same function, check run first and then reorder the array)
(array of all elements w attribute, that turns on and if it is already on, it will trigger a loss)

Need a function that first dispalys the new highscore if any made, then resets the array of states (or if passed thru props, it should get passed in again)

Structure:
App has 3 states: highscorescore and array (which has the current run attribute, named clicked) (store array in parent of app, give it down as props)
